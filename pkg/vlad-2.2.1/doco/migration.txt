== Converting from Capistrano

* 'set scm' is removed. Vlad.load :scm => :something if you don't use subversion.
* 'task' blocks are renamed to 'remote_task'.
* Most variables are the same. See variables.txt for details.
* No +with_command+ / +sudo+ / +via+ wonkiness
* Uses real ssh so env vars and the like are not a problem
  - no +with_env+ as a result.
* Vlad doesn't use ':no_release' or ':primary'.
  - If you have a task that needs to run on only one host from a role,
    you should declare a new role for that host:

      role :master_db, "master.example.com"

    ..and then override the role for the task you want to limit:

      Rake::Task["mytask"].options[:roles] = :master_db

* The 'host' method can be used to consolidate multiple 'role' calls.
  - host "www.example.com", :app, :web, :db
    specifies a host with three roles.
* migrate_env is now migrate_args.
* Vlad doesn't have before/after magic add-on tasks.

  role :web, domain
  role :app, domain
  role :db,  domain, :primary => true
