= Vlad the Deployer by the Ruby Hit Squad

* http://rubyhitsquad.com/
* http://rubyforge.org/projects/hitsquad/

== DESCRIPTION

Vlad the Deployer is pragmatic application deployment automation,
without mercy. Much like Capistrano, but with 1/10th the
complexity. Vlad integrates seamlessly with Rake, and uses familiar
and standard tools like ssh and rsync.

Impale your application on the heartless spike of the Deployer.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS

* Full deployment automation stack.
* Turnkey deployment for mongrel+apache+svn.
* Supports single server deployment with just 3 variables defined.
* Built on rake. Easy. Engine is small.
* Very few dependencies. All simple.
* Uses ssh with your ssh settings already in place.
* Uses rsync for efficient transfers.
* Run remote commands on one or more servers.
* Mix and match local and remote tasks.
* Compatible with all of your tab completion shell script rake-tastic goodness.
* Ships with tests that actually pass in 0.028 seconds!
* Does NOT support Windows right now (we think). Coming soon in 1.2.
