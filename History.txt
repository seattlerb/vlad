    and vlad/core.rb.

  * Removed :scm variable. Now a Vlad.load component/flavor/need-a-word-here.
  * Removed :application var. Use it if you want it. We don't require it.
  * Renamed :p4cmd to :p4_cmd.
  * Renamed :rake var to :rake_cmd.
* 2 (important) bug fixes:
  * HUGE: Fixed sudo hang bug #13072.  Fix suggested by Chris Van Pelt.
